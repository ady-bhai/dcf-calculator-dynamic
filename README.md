I appreciate Excel, but man is it boring to look at. 

I built this DCF calculator in hopes of making the process a bit more interactive and visual. I leveraged Streamlit for its easy front-end capabilities and Plotly for its visualizations. 

Using the Alpha Vantage API, you can fetch the free cash flow and outstanding shares. In designing this, I deepened my understanding of cash flow projections, present value calculations, terminal value estimation, and fair share price determination using metrics like discount rates and growth rates.

Love and peace gang love and peace
